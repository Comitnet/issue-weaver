      "bodyMarkdown": "Financial institutions have spent years upgrading tools and running red-team exercises, but regulators and customers now care above all about business disruption, not just \"cyber incidents\".\n\nThis feature reframes cybersecurity as a pillar of financial resilience. Instead of asking \"Are we secure?\", leading organisations ask what must never go down, what they can survive losing, and who owns those trade-offs across the business.\n\nThe goal is a governance model where the board sets resilience appetite, management turns that into concrete recovery targets, and the CISO becomes the guide for digital risk choices rather than the sole owner of \"cyber problems\"."

      "bodyMarkdown": "Cloud concentration risk is no longer an abstract diagram in a regulatory paper. Every new SaaS product, AI copilot and fintech integration quietly increases your dependency on a small set of providers.\n\nThis article breaks concentration risk into three board-friendly questions: where are we really dependent today, how long can critical services survive without that provider, and have we tested any realistic workaround instead of just writing it into a policy.\n\nWe outline options such as multi-region, multi-cloud, sovereign cloud, warm stand-by and manual fallback, explaining in plain language what each one costs in money, complexity and response time."

The promise is faster insight and fewer clicks.\n\nBut copilots sit in the messy middle between data, models and human judgement. If you drop them into production without training and guardrails, you mainly accelerate confusion and overconfidence.\n\nThis column suggests three steps before you roll out AI at the edge of money: define allowed use cases where AI can suggest but humans must decide, log and review prompts as operational data, and teach short, scenario-based \"AI street smarts\" instead of long policies no one reads."

Weeks 1–3 focus on mapping business-critical services, recent incidents and hard regulatory dates. Weeks 4–6 build a one-page view of the current resilience posture – people, process, technology and suppliers. Weeks 7–12 deliver one or two high-impact, low-drama initiatives that reduce real risk and demonstrate traction.\n\nYou will not fix everything in three months, but you can create clarity, momentum and a shared language for digital resilience."

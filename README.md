# Magazine Builder

Magazine Builder is an open-source web app for creating, previewing and exporting digital magazines.

It’s designed so non-technical editors can build issues like **“Digital Vault – Financial Cyber Resilience”** and then:

- Export a print-ready PDF (now or in a later backend step)
- Embed a read-only viewer inside existing sites (including Wix) via `<iframe>`
- Share or reuse issues via JSON

Although it was born at **Cyyder Management and Cyber LTD**, the tool is generic and can be used by any publisher.
